# Express.js Async Route Handler Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled asynchronous errors within route handlers.  When an asynchronous operation (like database query, API call) fails, the route handler might not send a proper response, leading to hanging requests on the client-side.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route handler that fetches user data asynchronously. If an error occurs during this operation, no error response is sent back to the client.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version of the route handler.  It uses `async/await` and a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle potential errors, ensuring that the client always receives a response, even in case of failure.
